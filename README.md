An Investigation of Android mobile Malware using the SherLock dataset and Big Data Tools

# Background & Motivation

To properly investigate mobile device malware, one must focus on the platforms on which most malware resides.  Currently, >85% of smartphone devices operate the Android OS, while [99% of mobile malware](https://safeandsavvy.f-secure.com/2017/02/15/another-reason-99-percent-of-mobile-malware-targets-androids/) is found on the Android platform.

# What is The SherLock Experiment?
A long-term smartphone sensor dataset with a high temporal resolution. The dataset also offers explicit labels capturing the to activity of malwares running on the devices. The dataset currently contains 10 billion data records from 30 users collected over a period of 2 years and an additional 20 users for 10 months (totaling 50 active users currently participating in the experiment).
The primary purpose of the dataset is to help security professionals and academic researchers in developing innovative methods of implicitly detecting malicious behavior in smartphones. Specifically, from data obtainable without superuser (root) privileges. However, this dataset can be used for research in domains that are not strictly security related. For example, context aware recommender systems, event prediction, user personalization and awareness, location prediction, and more. The dataset also offers opportunities that aren't available in other datasets. For example, the dataset contains the SSID and signal strength of the connected WiFi access point (AP) which is sampled once every second, over the course of many months.
